Canvas Compass Animation - 29/11/2015



#DESCRIPTION
This is a design I found on dribble and I decided to animate it. The compass doesn't move but on the city background, the clouds move from left to right. The animation plays automatically and endlessly.
This was written in HTML5 and JavaScript.


#FEATURES
The JavaScript allows to draw the entire canvas and animate the clouds with a change on evry frame of the loop. 


#RESOURCES



#INSPIRATION
I was inspired by this design from Dibble made by Aldo Crusher https://dribbble.com/shots/1966149-Compass


#PROBLEMS
The clouds seem to lag sometimes and I can find the origin of the problem. Maybe it's because it's too fast, or it has something to do with the opacity of my clouds.


#INSTALATION
No instalation needed.
