CSS3 Animation School Project - 18/10/2015



#DESCRIPTION
3D phone with a music player, music notes and equalizer which start when a music is played. To start the music, click on the play/pause button. 
Written in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.


#FEATURES
The JavaScript allows to play the music and change some CSS classes when the button is pressed. Then the new classes will allow to play the animations.


#RESOURCES
Music: Regina Spektor - Fidelity.
PNG music notes.


#INSPIRATION
CodePen for the CSS play/pause button.


#PROBLEMS
The play/pause button can be hard to press (maybe because the button shakes).
I had to use some JavaScript to start the animations only when the music is on.
Doesn't work on IE (maybe because of the perserve-3d).


#INSTALATION
No instalation needed.
